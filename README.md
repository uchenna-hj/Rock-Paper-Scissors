# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

This Python script executes a simple command-line version of the well-known game "Rock, Paper, Scissors" where a user plays against the computer.

## Description

The program prompts the player to input their choice (rock, paper, or scissors) and then matches it against the computer's randomly generated choice. The rules of the game are as follows:
- Rock beats scissors
- Paper beats rock
- Scissors beats paper

If both the player and the computer choose the same option, it is a tie. The game continues until the player decides to stop playing.

## How to Use it

- Python should be installed on your device.
- Run the script 'rockPaperScissor.py'
- Follow the instructions to input your choice and see the outcome against the computer.
- After each round, you will be prompted whether you want to play again. Enter "yes" to continue or any other input to end the game.
